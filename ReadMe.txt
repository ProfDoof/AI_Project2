STRUCTURE
	- The file to be run is "test.cpp in the "CipherGA" directory.
	- Most knobs can be adjusted from "test.cpp". If you want to change a 
	setting open "test.cpp" and edit the values going into the constructor
	accordingly.
	- Some values for knobs do not produce favorable output. One has to 
	have a fair combination of values to see results.

TEST FILES
	- Only files within the "Test_Files/Cipher" directory can be run by the program.
	If you want to run a new specific test case, upload your textfile of encoded text
	to this location and specify the filename in "test.cpp".

COMMANDS
