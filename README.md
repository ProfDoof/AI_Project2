In order to run the Genetic Algorithm implementation follow these commands
> cd ./CipherGA
> g++ -std=c++14 test.cpp -o test
> ./test

This should provide you a program that you can either let run with defaults or change the variables of. If you decide to change the variables you will need to look at the test files in the Cipher folder in the Test_Files folder. There you will find test files and then test meta files. Inside the meta files you can find the actual key with spaces in it. You will need to take the spaces out to use the key in the manual implementation of the GA.
